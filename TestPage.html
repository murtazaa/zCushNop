    <p class="bold bottom-margin-minus-10">1. What are the benefits of using the zCush Baby Nap Mat?</p>
    <p>The benefits are many, the most important of which is the ability to hold your newborn with better support and comfort, for bonding, for feeding or just because. And when he isn’t in your own arms, you can safely pass him from one person to the next. The mat can also be used to lay him down on a flat surface to play with or even to change his diaper. And don’t forget —you can take it with you anytime, anywhere. Just roll it up and place it into the convenient carrying bag that came with it.</p>
    <p class="bold bottom-margin-minus-10">2. What is the zCush Baby Nap Mat made from?</p>
    <p>Soft hypoallergenic polyester sheets with a 100% cotton shell.</p>
